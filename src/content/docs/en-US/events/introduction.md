Events are the backbone of the interactivity in your game. They are what you use to give players their quests, browse shops, environmental puzzles, chests, doors, cutscenes, and just about anything you would want to do outside of combat.

Events can be created directly on maps, but global events can also be made with the common events editor. Each event acts as a container for what you are wanting to do so any given map may have multiple events running or accessible on it.
