Events are the backbone of the interactivity in your game. Events are what allows you to give players quests, browse shops, environmental puzzles, chests, doors, cutscenes, and just about anything you would want to do outside of combat. Events are placed on your map or ran with the common event editor. Each event acts as a container for what you are wanting to do so any given map may have multiple events running or accessible on it.
