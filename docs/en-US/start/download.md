## File Structure Overview
Once you extract your files, you can you’re your file and should see three folders:
- Client and Editor: The client-side of the engine, which is the “game” component you and others will use to play your MMO.
- Documentation: Various documents and ReadMe files. We encourage you browse these before starting.
