# Installing Visual Studio
Visual Studio is required to compile Intersect's source code. This page will walk you through the steps of installing Visual Studio 2019.

Click [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16) to download the Visual Studio 2019 community installer.

Run the installer, and hit continue on the first screen you see.

When done, visual studio will automatically launch. You can select 'Not now, maybe later.' when it asks you to connect accounts.
