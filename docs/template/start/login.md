 ## Start Creating!
 Welcome to Intersect! You now have the power in your hands to begin sculpting a world every bit as wild as your imagination. 
 
 You are looking at our map editor now, you can place the tiles from tilesets on the left onto the map. Clicking the save button will make those changes appear in your game. 
 
 Double clicking the bordering area surrounding your map will allow you to expand your world and create more maps that appear seamless in-game.

 Clicking next below will go over the various windows and components in our editor. We encourage you mess around with the editor on your own and then come back and refer to the documentation whenever you come across something that isn't intuitive or clear. Learning to use new software and creating a game takes time and can be very challenging. Don't forget to have some fun!
